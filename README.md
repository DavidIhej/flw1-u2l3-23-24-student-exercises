# Lesson 2.3: Arrays

## Arrays: Organizing Your Data

Imagine you have a pile of papers from school, and you need to organize them. That's where arrays come in!

### What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. Arrays are one such data structure that helps us organize information.

### Declaring an Array

In JavaScript, we can declare an array like this:

```javascript
let numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"];
let emptyArray = [];
```

- Array elements are listed inside square brackets and separated by commas.

### Array Elements

An array element is each individual value in an array. For example:

```javascript
let artists = ["BeyoncÃ©", "Drake", "Billie Eilish", "BTS", "Ariana Grande"];
```

- Array name: `artists`
- Array elements: ["BeyoncÃ©", "Drake", "Billie Eilish", "BTS", "Ariana Grande"]

### Using Arrays

Arrays are frequently used in websites, apps, and games. Examples include photo galleries, music playlists, shopping carts, and more.


### Array Index

An array index is the location of an array element. The first array index is always 0.


### Retrieving Elements by Index

You can retrieve a value from an array by using the array name followed by the index number in square brackets. For example:

```javascript
let pets = ["guinea pig", "gecko", "bird", "cat", "snake"];
let favoritePet = pets[1];
console.log(favoritePet); // This prints "gecko"
```
